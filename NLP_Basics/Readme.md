## Natural Language Processing
* An area of computer science and artificial intillegence concerned with the interactions between computers and human(natural) langauges, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural langauge data.
* Often when performing analysis, lots of data is numerical, such as sales numbers, physical measurements, quantifiable categories.
* Computers are very good at handling direct numerical information.
* But what do we about <b>text data?</b>
   * Text data is highly unstructured data and can be in multiple languages.
   * NLP attempts to use a variety of techniques in order to create structure out of text data.


### What is Spacy?
1. For many NLP tasks, spacy only has one implemented method, choosing the most efficient algorithm currently available.
2. This means you often don't have the option to choose other algorithms.


### What is NLTK?
1. NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit is a very popular open source.
2. Initially released in 2001, it is much older than spacy.
3. It also provides many functionalities, but includes less efficient implementations.

### NLT vs Spacy
    For many common NLP tasks, spacy is much faster and more efficient, at the cost of the user not being able to choose algorithmic implementations.
