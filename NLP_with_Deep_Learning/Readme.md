## Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
* Recurrent neural network is one type of deep learning-oriented algorithm which follows a sequential approach.
* These type of neural networks are called recurrent because they perform mathematical computations in sequential manner.
* I think [this](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/12/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks/) is the best article to understand RNN.
* There different types of Recurrent Nueral Networks
    * Sequence to Sequence (Many to Many)
    * Sequence to Vector (Many to One)
    * Vector to Sequence (One to Many)

## Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)
* An issue RNN face is that after a while the network will begin to *forget* the first inputs, as information is lost at each step going through the RNN alos this is called as <i><b>vanishing gradient</b></i> problem.
* We need some sort of *long-term memorey* for our networks. The LSTM cell was created to help address these RNN issues.
* [This](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/12/fundamentals-of-deep-learning-introduction-to-lstm/) is the link for full theory behind the LSTM.
