## Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
* Recurrent neural network is one type of deep learning-oriented algorithm which follows a sequential approach.
* These type of neural networks are called recurrent because they perform mathematical computations in sequential manner.
* I think [this](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/12/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks/) is the best article to understand RNN.
