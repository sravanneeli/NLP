## Topic Modeling
* Topic Modeling allows for us to efficiently analyze large volumes of text by clustering documents into topics.
* A large amount of text data is unlabeled meaning we won't be able to apply our supervised learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data!
* If we have unlabeled data, then we can atempt to *discover* labels.
