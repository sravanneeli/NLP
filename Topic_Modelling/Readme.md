## Topic Modeling
* Topic Modeling allows for us to efficiently analyze large volumes of text by clustering documents into topics.
* A large amount of text data is unlabeled meaning we won't be able to apply our supervised learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data!
* If we have unlabeled data, then we can atempt to *discover* labels.
* In this case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents, grouped together by topic.
* A very important idea to keep in mind here is that we don't know the **correct** topic
* All we know is that the documents clustered together share similary topic ideas.
* It is up to user to identify what these topics represent.

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA)
* There is a probability distribution named after "Dirichlet Distribution".
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation is based off this probabiltiy distribution.
* In 2003 LDA was first published as a graphical model for topic discovery in a Journal.
